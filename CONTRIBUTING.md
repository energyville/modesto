Your contribution is welcome through the issue tracker. 
When you find a bug, have a suggestion or would like a feature to be added, open 
an issue and sufficiently describe it. 
If possible, add an example that makes it easier to reproduce a bug you found. 

If you want to help developping, you can automatically create a new branch for 
your issue. 
To do so, open the drop-down menu next to "Create merge request" in your freshly 
opened issue; then, click "Create branch". 
This workflow is important because it makes it easier afterwards to open a 
merge request and close the issue.
